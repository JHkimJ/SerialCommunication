### WriteFile();  UP55A에 있는 Configuration of Commands Protocol에 따른 Transe Data 하기위한 설명
#### 01010WRR01D0003
#### 0x02 01 01 0 WRR 01 D0003 0X03 0X0D
#### 0x02  = STX,
#### 01  = Adr No.01~99,
#### 01  = CPU No.(Fixed 01),
#### 0   = Response waiting time 0~F(HEX),
#### WRR = Command , //Word-basis, Random Read
#### 01  = 등록된 Register Size 지정,
#### D0003 = PV읽기위한 Register,
#### 0X03  = ETX
#### 0X0D  = CR

#### (1) STX (Start of Text)
#### This indicates the start of the command. ASCII code is 02 in hexadecimal.
#### (2) Address No. (01 to 99)
#### This No. is for enabling the host computer to identify the UTAdvanced at the 
#### communication destination. (These are the ID Nos. of each UTAdvanced.)
#### (3) CPU No.
#### Fixed at “01”
#### (4) Response waiting time
#### A waiting time (time delay) from transmission of a command up to reception of a 
#### response can be set.
#### Set the response waiting time within 0 to 600 ms using characters 0 to F
#### (5) Command (For a list of commands, see “3.2.6 Commands and Responses.”)
#### The instruction (command) from the host computer is specified.
#### (6) Data corresponding to command
#### Internal register (D register / I relay), number of data points, etc. are specified
#### (7) Checksum
#### The ASCII codes of text from the character following STX up to before the checksum 
#### are added one byte at a time. The lowermost byte of the addition result is removed, 
#### and an ASCII text string of two bytes expressed in Hex is taken to be the checksum.
#### This column is required only when performing PC link communication with a 
#### checksum.
#### When performing PC link communication without a checksum, this ASCII code 2-byte 
#### area is not required.
#### (8) ETX (End of Text)
#### This indicates the end of the command. ASCII code is 03 in hexadecimal.
#### (9) CR (Carriage Return)
#### This indicates the end of the command line. ASCII code is 0D in hexadecimal
### ReadFile(); RXD (Receive Data) 읽어오기
#### COM# 에 Transe(WriteFile) 해준걸 Read 해준다

### ReOpenFile();
#### 기존핸들이 (장치)연결 해제 될때 Port 재연결시 기존핸들을 다시 잡을때 사용
